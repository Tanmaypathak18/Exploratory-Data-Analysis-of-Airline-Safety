# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-Airline-Safety
This project analyzes airline safety data to uncover trends in incidents, accidents, and fatalities. It compares carrier performance across time, evaluates regulatory impacts, and explores links between fleet size, operations, and risk. Includes data preprocessing, analysis, and visualizations for clear insights.
# Airline Safety Analysis

## Features  
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Exploratory analysis of incidents and accidents  
- Comparison of airline performance across time ranges  
- Statistical insights on fleet size vs. safety outcomes  
- Visualizations (charts and plots) for clarity  

## Dataset  
The dataset includes airline safety information with records of incidents, accidents, and fatalities over multiple time periods.  

## Tools & Technologies  
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy)  
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization  

## Results  
- Identified carriers with consistently higher or lower safety records  
- Highlighted the effect of regulation on overall safety trends  
- Provided visual comparisons for easier interpretation
